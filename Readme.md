This is a very simple driver for Blue Chip Technology's PCI Data Acquisition Card (PCIADC):

http://www.bluechiptechnology.co.uk/Product/PCIADC-Data-Aquisition-Card

It was used successfully to read analog inputs, but has not been used (or updated) in some years.

I'm putting this here mainly as an archive, but if any body finds it useful, by all means use it.
